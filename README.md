# Advent of Code
This is where I keep my solutions to the annual Advent of Code challenge. 2019 solutions are currently housed in a separate repository, but links to individual solutions can be found below.

# About

> Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. More information [here](https://adventofcode.com/2020/about).

Puzzles are released every day in December. I like to solve them in Python.
